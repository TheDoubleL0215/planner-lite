# Planner Lite

Planner Lite is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to simplify the organization of homework and exams for students. With Planner Lite, users can easily note down their tasks, assignments, and exam schedules to effectively manage their workload.

## Features
- **Note your homework and exams**: Pressing a button calculates the time of the next class and sets the deadline accordingly.
- **Add Reminders**: To remember important tasks for a class, such as "bringing a new exercise book" or "handing in money for a class trip", you can add them as reminders. These reminders will appear on the schedule page.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design with [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) for easy navigation and usage.
